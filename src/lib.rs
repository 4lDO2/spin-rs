#![deny(missing_docs)]

//! This crate provides spin-based versions of the primitives in `std::sync`. Because synchronization is done
//! through spinning, the primitives are suitable for use in `no_std` environments.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - `Mutex`, `RwLock` and `Once` equivalents
//!
//! - Support for `no_std` environments
//!
//! - [`lock_api`](https://crates.io/crates/lock_api) compatibility
//!
//! - Upgradeable `RwLock` guards
//!
//! - Guards can be sent and shared between threads
//!
//! - Guard leaking
//!
//! # Relationship with `std::sync`
//!
//! While `spin` is not a drop-in replacement for `std::sync` (and
//! [should not be considered as such](https://matklad.github.io/2020/01/02/spinlocks-considered-harmful.html))
//! an effort is made to keep this crate reasonably consistent with `std::sync`.
//!
//! Many of the types defined in this crate have 'additional capabilities' when compared to `std::sync`:
//!
//! - Because spinning does not depend on the thread-driven model of `std::sync`, guards ([`MutexGuard`],
//!   [`RwLockReadGuard`], [`RwLockWriteGuard`], etc.) may be sent and shared between threads.
//!
//! - [`RwLockUpgradableGuard`] supports being upgrades into a [`RwLockWriteGuard`].
//!
//! - Guards support [leaking](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/leaking.html).
//!
//! - [`Once`] owns the value returned by its `call_once` initializer.
//!
//! - [`RwLock`] supports counting readers and writers.
//!
//! Conversely, the types in this crate do not have some of the features `std::sync` has:
//!
//! - Locks do not track [panic poisoning](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/poisoning.html).
